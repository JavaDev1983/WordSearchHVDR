## App Configuration Options

Class `WordSearchValues` contains all configuration variables.
1. Variable `gameboardDimension` - size of the gameboard (set to 12x12).
	* The larger the value, the more likely the gameboard will not fit the resolution of the device.

2. Variable `maxWordLength` - maximum length of the word from the repository to place on the gameboard (set to 10).
	* `maxWordLenght` must be less than or equal to gameboard dimension.
	* The smaller the length, the more likely the app will find a placement for the word on the gameboard.

3. Variable `maxWords` - the number of words to place on the gameboard (set to 6).
	* Must be an even number between 2 and 10.
	* The larger the value, the more likely the app will not find a placement for the word on the gameboard.
	* The larger the value, the more likely the buttons will not fit the resolution of the device.

4. Variable `maxPlacementAttempts` - number of attempts to find a word placement on the gameboard (set to 50).
	* If no replacement is found the word is excluded.
	* If this value is set too high may cause the app to crash.

5. Variable `maxWordAttempts` - number of attempts to found a word from the repository that is equal to or less than `maxWordLength` (set to 100).

6. Variable `enableShowResultButton` - ability to show or hide the `Show Result` button (set to true).

> Note: Each of the above variables will affect the app performance and most be changed with caution.

## App Word Repository

Class `WordRepository` contain a list of 40 words as a simple repository.
* The length of the word varies. For example, *Imperceptible* is 13 characters and will never be selected for a gameboard dimension of 12x12.
* Variable `wordSet` is a Set and duplicate words will not exist.

> Note: It's worth mentioning that this is not a best practice and `WordRepository` should be referencing a SQLite/Room database.
